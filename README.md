# Subscription-Cohort-Analysis

## Project Overview
Mavenflix is a subscription-based streaming platform with global customers, and the goal of this project is to analyze customer retention and churn rates using a cohort analysis approach, covering data from September 2022 to September 2023.
The key deliverable is a power Bi visual that illustrates retention trends and highliht critical insights for Mavenflix leadership to understand customer behavior better and make data-driven decisions.

### Key Findings
- Each month saw approximately a 20% drop in customer retention compared to the previous month.
- The trend indicates significant churn issue that could result from underlying factors such as lack of engaging content, poor user experience, or better alterntive from competitors.

### Recommendations
To improve customer retention, Mavenflix leadership should consider:
- **Customer Feedback:** Use email or surveys to gather insights from customers who didn't renew their subscriptions.
- **Incentives:** Introduce irresistible offers, loyalty programs, or discounts to encourage resubscription.
- **Content Strategy:** Invest in more enaging and exclusive content tailored to customer preferences.

### Visual Preview

### Approach
- The dataset is clean, so data cleaning wasn't a necessity here. I went straight to data transformation. I changed data types where necessary and reshaped the dataset.
- I dived into analysis, calculations and transformations were implemented using DAX formulas in Power Bi.
- **Visualization**, I created a heatmap-style cohort analysis visual to display customer retention percentages across months.
